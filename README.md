# HFrisk-Op-Amp
This is a Ngspice model of a simple operational amplifier consisting of an input differential pair, an intermediate stage, and an output push-pull stage. 

The repository also contains a single stage op amp circuit (SingleStageOpAmp.cir) that only contains the first stage of the complete operational amplifier (OpAmp.cir).
